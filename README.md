abstract="Superquadrics are one of the ideal shape representations for adapting various kinds of primitive shapes with a single equation. This paper revisits the task of representing a 3D human body with multiple superquadrics. As a single superquadric surface can only represent symmetric primitive shapes, we present a method that segments the human body into body parts to estimate their superquadric parameters. Moreover, we propose a novel initial parameter estimation method by using 3D skeleton joints. The results show that superquadric parameters are estimated, which represent human body parts volumetrically.",
